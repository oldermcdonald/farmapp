### GA - Software Engineering Immersive Project 4

A simple todo list that works offline for farmers to manage tasks.

### Brief:
Make a todo list app with a map component that can work offline. The intention is that farmers can add tasks to their list when offline and have GPS coordinates saved with the task so that they can return to the exact spot.


### Example Scenario:
 A farmer finds a noxious weed in the paddock while working. She opens the app on her phone which still works even without internet access. She adds a todo item about the weed to remind her to return to the exact spot in a couple of months to check if it is erradicated. When she returns back to the house at the end of the day, her phone background syncs the todo item up to the server over wifi.
